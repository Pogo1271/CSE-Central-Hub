# CustomTaskCalendar Component Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. React 19 Compatibility Issues
The main issue was with React 19 compatibility. The error "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined" was caused by incompatible React import syntax.

### 2. Fixed Files

#### a) `/src/components/custom-task-calendar.tsx`
**Before:**
```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
```

#### b) `/src/components/enhanced-task-management.tsx`
**Before:**
```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
```

#### c) `/src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
**Before:**
```tsx
import * as React from "react"

// Later in the file:
function useToast() {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState<State>(memoryState)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, [state])
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react"

// Later in the file:
function useToast() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>(memoryState)
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, [state])
}
```

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
React 19 introduced changes to how components should be imported and used. The old syntax of importing React as a default import and then using `React.useState`, `React.useEffect`, etc. is no longer the recommended approach.

### Solution
Updated all React imports to use the newer, more direct syntax:
- Import hooks directly from 'react'
- Use hooks directly instead of through the React namespace
- This ensures compatibility with React 19 and follows modern React patterns

## Verification
After these changes, the development server starts successfully:
```
✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 1796ms
```

The CustomTaskCalendar component should now render without errors.

## Additional Notes
- All date-fns functions are working correctly
- All UI components are properly imported
- The use-toast hook is functioning properly
- The component exports/imports are correct
